# Rust One More Line

Rip off of my fav mobile game [One More Line](https://onemorelinegame.com/) written in Rust with ggez. Made for fun.

Doesn't track score yet, and the score goes down if you go backwards, but I think the 'physics' work well enough.

To run it just git clone and `cargo run`. Only tested on an Arm64 Mac.
